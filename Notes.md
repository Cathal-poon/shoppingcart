Python Solution

Work on shopping_cart.py
Don't change / modify the interface

## Tasks
- [x] Add Total Line
- [x] Have receipt print in order 
- [x] Allow for different formatting options
- [ ] Change tests and test suite to be more flexible
- [x] Have something extra

### Total
Keep a running track

### In Order Receipt
Dictonary is ordered (3.6+). If we want same items to print together then keeping it as is will be fine. <br>
If we don't want same items to be grouped together: <br>
Print receipt is called once <br>
Use a Queue or a List <br>

### Allow for different formatting
Allow an fString to be passed in as an argument if desired

Need to change code to allow for selection of printing together or inorder

I only added tests and didnt remove any or modify any
So changing tests didn't make sense in this situation.

### Extra Stuff
I made it so you can choose to print items as the come in or to group the same items together before printing
